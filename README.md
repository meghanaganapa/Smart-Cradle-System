# Smart-Cradle-System

Parents face many hurdles to nurture their infants, especially if both the parents are working. To
give 24 hours of time to babies in such cases is next to impossible. Thus, we developed
something unique that can help parents to have a continuous surveillance/watch on the baby and
can notify about the same.

Thus, we have come up with an idea to design a Smart Cradle System using IOT which will help
parents to monitor their baby even if they are away from home & detect every activity of the
baby from any distant corner of the world.

We built a system using Nodemcu. Whenever the cradle is wet, the water sensor detects it
and the NodeMCU sends a message to the mobile phone. We also have a continuous monitoring
system that takes a picture of the baby in the cradle every 30 minutes and sends the message to
the parent if the baby is crying or is fearing about something. The system also starts playing a
song so that the baby feels comforted.

We developed this using NodeMCU and a water sensor for the hardware set up. We used
Jupyter Notebook, Python and Arduino IDE for executing our code.
